Abstract Vaccine hesitancy and other COVID-19-related concerns and complaints in the Philippines are evident on social media. It is important to identify these different topics and sentiments in order to gauge public opinion, use the insights to develop policies, and make necessary adjustments or actions to improve public image and reputation of the administering agency and the COVID-19 vaccines themselves. This paper proposes a semi-supervised ma- chine learning pipeline to perform topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and an analysis of vaccine brand reputation to obtain an in-depth understanding of national public opinion of Filipinos on Facebook. The methodology makes use of a multilingual version of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers or BERT for topic modeling, hierarchical clustering, five dif- ferent classifiers for sentiment analysis, and cosine similarity of BERT topic embeddings for vaccine brand reputation analysis. Results suggest that any type of COVID-19 misinformation is an emergent property of COVID-19 public opinion, and that the detection of COVID-19 misinformation can be an unsupervised task. Sentiment analysis aided by hierarchical clustering reveal that 21 of the 25 topics extrapolated by topic modeling are negative topics. Such negative comments spike in count whenever the Department of Health in the Philippines posts about the COVID-19 situation in other countries. Additionally, the high numbers of laugh reactions on the Face- book posts by the same agencyÃ¢ÂÂwithout any humorous contentÃ¢ÂÂsuggest that the reactors of these posts tend to react the way they do, not because of what the posts are about but because of who posted them. Keywords: COVID-19, vaccine brand reputation, vaccine hesitancy, sentiment analysis, topic modeling Highlights 1. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in the Philippines is primarily due to mis- information 2. Posting about the COVID-19 situation in other countries increase neg- ative comments 3. Laugh reactions on humorless posts suggest they are targeted at the source of posts 4. Sputnik V, AstraZeneca, and Sinovac suffer from a negative public reputation 5. Ministries of health and stakeholders in vaccination campaigns are rec- ommended to employ interventions that correct misinformation, engage people and use local narratives of success Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has drastically affected the overall wellness and health of the entire world. On January 30, 2020, the first case of COVID- 19, in the Philippines, has been reported by the countryÃ¢ÂÂs Department of Health (DOH). COVID-19 is a respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV- 2 virusÃ¢ÂÂfirst identified in the province of Wuhan, located in China (Paules et al., 2020). Over a year later, on March 1, 2021, the Philippines started with its COVID-19 vaccination program. Vaccine hesitancy among Filipinos is an on- going phenomenon that the national vaccine campaign efforts are struggling with (Alfonso et al., 2021). According to a recent study in the Philippines (Caple et al., 2021), only 62.5% of their 7,193 respondents are willing to be vaccinated against COVID-19. A majority of the same respondents are only willing to be inoculated after many others have received the vaccine or after political figures have done so (Caple et al., 2021). Additionally, the partici- pantsÃ¢ÂÂ preferences of vaccine brand are also studied; 59.7% of the participants are confident in a USA-made or European-made COVID-19 vaccine (Caple et al., 2021). Sentiment analysis is a common natural language processing (NLP) task that has been done on a number of studies regarding COVID-19 public opin- ion (Melton et al., 2021; Garcia and Berton, 2021). It computationally classi- fies the polarity of text dataÃ¢ÂÂneutral, positive, or negative sentiment. This is primarily done since gauging the sentiment of the public, especially on critical topics such as a pandemic like COVID-19, help determine possible policies and interventions that could shape the actions that society takes. Furthermore, topic modeling is proposed as part of the NLP pipeline of the same studies mentioned earlier. Topic modeling is an unsupervised technique for obtaining the relevant ideas that public opinion holds, more of which is discussed in a later section of this article. This paper proposes a pipeline for understanding the public opinion in the Philippines regarding COVID-19 and the countryÃ¢ÂÂs vaccination efforts. The semi-supervised pipeline is named Vaccine-related Exploratory Research via Topic Extraction, Brand Reputation Analysis, andEmotions (VER- TEBRATE). It is comprised of three main modules: a topic extraction or topic modeling of opinions, an analysis of vaccine brand reputation, and a sentiment analysis of the same set of opinions. Topic modeling is per- formed through the use of contextual embeddings provided by a multilingual transformer architectureÃ¢ÂÂdiscussed further in Section 2.3. The topics ob- tained are compared and associated with the vaccine brands available in the Philippines through cosine similarity. Next, a hierarchical clustering of the topics extrapolated through topic modeling is used to assign the labels used for sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis on the data is performed by five different classification algorithmsÃ¢ÂÂassessing which architecture models the sentiments of the text data most effectively. The classification algorithms proposed are XGBoost, LightGBM, K-nearest neighbors, Naive BayesÃ¢ÂÂ al- gorithm, and support vector machine. The public opinions considered for this study are comments made on 50 different Facebook posts by the official page of the Department of Health Philippines. The posts are part of the RESBAKUNA campaign of the same government department. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has radically changed the world. Over a year after the start of the outbreak, worldwide vaccine efforts against COVID-19 have begun. On the first day of March 2021, the Philippines started its vac- cination program under the RESBAKUNA campaign. A recent study shows that vaccine hesitancy is a prevalent issue in the Philippines. The same concerns and complaints over the COVID-19 vaccines can also be found on social media, like Facebook. To understand and gauge national public opinion via the Facebook platform, the top comments from 50 Facebook posts of the official Facebook page of the Department of Health Philippines were scraped via Selenium and Python. The 50 Facebook posts are part of the Ã¢ÂÂ#RESBAKUNAÃ¢ÂÂ Facebook campaign by the agency. Next, a semi- supervised pipeline named Vaccine-related Exploratory Research via Topic Extraction, Brand Reputation Analysis, and Topic Emotions or VERTE- BRATE is proposed. It is a pipeline that leverages topic modeling via multi- lingual BERT, analysis of vaccine brand reputation through cosine similarity of the BERT topic embeddings, hierarchical clustering of the BERT topic embeddings, and sentiment classification of the Facebook comments that are labeled automatically by the clades produced by the hierarchical clustering model. The BERT topic model extracted 25 topicsÃ¢ÂÂ2 of which are indeter- minable, 2 of which are positive, and 21 topics are negative comments. These topics are precisely clustered through WardÃ¢ÂÂs linkage hierarchical clustering. The model suggests that COVID-19 misinformation and COVID-19 vaccine misinformation are emergent properties of COVID-19 public opinion. Using supervised techniques to model such misinformation is unnecessary. In terms of the temporal distribution of these topics, the analysis suggests that neg- ative comments drastically increase when the Department of Health Philip- pines posts about other countries. It can also be noted that the huge numbers of laugh reactions throughout the Facebook postsÃ¢ÂÂwithout the presence of any humorous contentÃ¢ÂÂentail that the Department of Health Philippines has a public image issue. In this instance, people tend to react the way they do, not because of the posts but because of who posted them. As for the brand reputation of the different COVID-19 vaccines, Pfizer and Moderna are doing relatively wellÃ¢ÂÂespecially PfizerÃ¢ÂÂs vaccine. Mean- while, Sputnik V, AstraZeneca, and Sinovac suffer from negative associations. Additionally, clade-assisted sentiment classification effectively models public sentiment. The best-performing classifier, LightGBM, that is proposed in the study has managed to perform with 92.4% accuracy. It also has a strong level of agreement in terms of CohenÃ¢ÂÂs kappa statistic, with a value of 0.847. Our present study highlights the persisting prevalence of COVID-19 vac- cine misinformation in social media. Conspiracy beliefs and other forms of misinformation had been noted as a significant predictor of complete vac- cine hesitancy (Al-Sanafi and Sallam, 2021). We noticed that DOH and its entities offered no responses to the comments posted by netizens under these infographics. Meta-analytic evidence suggests the importance of iden- tifying misinformation most susceptible to correction, and engage experts in responding to misinformation (Walter et al., 2020). We recommend for DOH to form a social media team composed of health care professionals and in- terdisciplinary communication practitioners whose mandate is to respond to misinformation found in theof their posts. This engaging way of correcting false vaccine information will not only help quell vaccine doubts, but also hopefully improve the image of DOH among citizens. Also, our present study suggests that instead of drawing aspirational sen- timents from people, posting about the success of wealthier countries in terms of vaccination and COVID-19 vaccine brand are also showing in the Philippines and the Philippines is due to the partici- pantsÃ¢ÂÂ preferences of vaccine brand are also studied. Results suggest that instead of drawing aspirational sen- timents from the people who are most likely to be affected by COVID-19, instead of drawing them about the COVID-19 situation in other countries increase neg- ative comments and increase swear words.
