Abstract We present the task of Automated Punish- ment Extraction (APE) in sentencing decisions from criminal court cases in Hebrew. Ad- dressing APE will enable the identification of sentencing patterns and constitute an im- portant stepping stone for many follow up le- gal NLP applications in Hebrew, including the prediction of sentencing decisions. We curate a dataset of sexual assault sentencing decisions and a manually-annotated evalua- tion dataset, and implement rule-based and su- pervised models. We find that while super- vised models can identify the sentence contain- ing the punishment with good accuracy, rule- based approaches outperform them on the full APE task. We conclude by presenting a first analysis of sentencing patterns in our dataset and analyze common modelsÃ¢ÂÂ errors, indicat- ing avenues for future work, such as distin- guishing between probation and actual imprisonment punishment. We will make all our re- sources available upon request, including data, annotation, and first benchmark models. Introduction The legal world is rife with data, from constitu- tions and national legislation to legal cases and court decisions. Much of the legal data, however, comes in unstructured formats that pose critical challenges for extracting and analyzing it in sys- tematic ways. In addition, different countries vary in their legal systems, norms and conventions, fur- ther compounding the challenges in developing multilingual approaches (Peruginelli, 2009). While legal NLP is gaining traction in recent years (Van Gog and Van Engers, 2001; Dale, 2019; Zhong et al., 2020), relatively little attention has been given to low-resource settings outside of the English language, where the availability of tools such as large pretrained language models, syntactic parsers, or named entity recognizers is limited. In this work, conducted as part of an on-going collaboration with The Association of Rape Crisis Centers in Israel (ARCCI), we focus specifically on the task of Automated Punishment Extraction (APE) in sexual assault cases in Hebrew within Israeli court sentencing decisions (see formal task definition in Section 2). Punishment decisions are of special importance as they constitute a prerequi- site for many other downstream tasks in legal NLP and digital humanities, such as legal prediction of judicial decisions (Aletras et al., 2016; Branting et al., 2021) and detecting biases in court deci- sions (Pinto et al., 2020). APE is difficult in the Israeli court system. This is due to the fact that sen- tencing decisions for criminal offences are reported, in natural language idiomatic to the legal field, in the written sentencing decision. We focus on sex- ual assault cases due to the legal and public debate around claims of lenient punishments (Phillips and Chagnon, 2020), that in the absence of system- atic rigorous data collection cannot be empirically examined and assessed. This worldwide debate requires legal NLP methods in multiple languages and legal systems. To address this challenge, we begin by curating a dataset of sexual assault sentencing decisions from the years 1990-2021 and manually annotate pun- ishment in a subset of 100 cases with the use of legal experts in our team and in collaboration with ARCCI (Section 3). Following, in Section 4, we use this data to build several models for the APE task, including rule-based and supervised methods, based on linguistically and semantically informed features, setting first benchmark results on the APE task in Hebrew. We thoroughly analyze our modelsÃ¢ÂÂ performance in Section 5, finding that they are ca- pable of extracting the correct punishment in 68% of the cases,while the best modelÃ¢ÂÂs average error is roughly 5 months, attesting to the difficulty of the task. Based on our models, we find that in our data the median predicted punishment is 3 years, while more than a third of the punishments are below 15 months. Although these figures are obtained on a medium-size corpus, using automatic measures which do not account for the type of offense, we note that they are well below the maximum pun- ishments for sexual offenses as determined by the Israeli legislator, which range between 2-7 years for indecent acts and sodomy and up to 20 years for aggravated rape. We conclude by analyzing common error pat- terns in our models. For example, we find that models often tend to erroneously extract a proba- tion imprisonment punishment instead of the actual imprisonment punishment. Distinguishing between the two is left as an interesting avenue for future work. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first examination of automatic punishment extraction in the Hebrew language.includes data collection, annotation, and benchmark models. We hope it will spur further research into this important task. Conclusions In this work we created the first annotated corpus of Hebrew language sentencing decisions, focus- ing on sexual assaults. We compared a rule-based approach with supervised learners using the unique attributes of the legal language for representing sentences. We found that while super- vised models can identify the sentence contain- ing the punishment with good accuracy, rule- based approaches outperform them on the full APE task. We conclude by presenting a first analysis of sentencing patterns in our dataset and analyze common modelsÃ¢ÂÂ errors, indicat- ing avenues for future work, such as distin- guishing between probation and actual imprisonment punishment. We will make all our re- sources available upon request, including data, annotation, and first benchmark models.
