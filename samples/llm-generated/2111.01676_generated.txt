ABSTRACT This paper reports on an experiment into text-based phishing detection using readily available resources and without the use of semantics. The developed algorithm is a modified version of previously published work that works with the same tools. The results obtained in recognizing phishing emails are considerably better than the previously reported work; but the rate of text falsely identified as phishing is slightly worse. It is expected that adding semantic component will reduce the false positive rate while preserving the detection accuracy. INTRODUCTION Phishing is one of the most potentially disruptive actions that can be performed on the internet. Stealing a userÃ¢ÂÂs account information within a business network through a phishing scam can be an easy way to gain access to that business network. Intellectual property and other pertinent business information could potentially be at risk if a user behind the keyboard falls for a phishing attack. The most common way of carrying out a phishing attack is through email. While such attacks may be easily identifiable for those well-versed in technology, it may be difficult for the typical internet user to spot a fraudulent email. According to RSA (Brook 2012), there have been nearly 33 thousand phishing attacks each month in 2012. The total loss from these attacks as of August of 2012 was around $690 million, and over $1.5 billion (Kessem 2013) by the end of the year. This is a 59% increase from 2011 in the number of phishing attacks and 22% higher in the losses. It clear that the phishing attacks are on the rise. The results of the phishing attack can be devastating, as a recent example of the attack on South Korea showed: an attack that shut down several prominent South Korean banks and broadcasters in March 2013 had an origin as a spear phishing campaign (Donohue 2013). The recommended defense against phishing attacks is to educate a user not to fall for them. Unfortunately, the awareness campaigns are not the most effective solution: it only takes one employee to fall for the bait for a company and for its clients to become vulnerable. Because phishing emails rely on human emotions, it is essential to provide an emotion-free solution to a phishing detection game. Such a solution should work before a user can click on the fraudulent link and, thus, before any damage can be made. At the same time, if a user is well educated and understands that an email is a phishing attempt, it should be possible for the user to indicate it as such, so that the solution software has a chance to validate its results or correct its evaluation based on real-time data. To make it more complicated, phishing emails can target a particular individual or a small group of individuals based on their known behaviors. Thus, it is important for the software to adapt to individual characteristics of an individual or a group of individuals and predict their vulnerabilities for phishing. There is a need for a phishing-detection application to understand Ã¢ÂÂthe buttonsÃ¢ÂÂ that are being pushed by fraudulent emails. When such buttons are detected, it is possible to react to them in a desired way. To date, there have been a number of papers that report detection of phishing emails (Hong 2012, Basnet et al 2008, Cleber et al 2011, Mutton 2011, Aaron 2010, Xiang 2011, Shahriar & Zulkernine 2012) based on non-text features claiming an accuracy over 90%. Yet, the problem still exists and growing. One possible explanation of this is these methods donÃ¢ÂÂt address the content of the messages that people fall for. BACKGROUND Phishing is a malicious use of internet resources done to trick internet users to reveal personal information to the attacker. An attack is typically performed by sending an email to an unsuspecting user that contains a link to a domain that is seemingly legitimate in the hopes that the user will input their private information for the attacker to steal (DigiCert 2009). Phishing is a criminal act which uses a combination of Ã¢ÂÂsocial engineering and technical subterfugeÃ¢ÂÂ to steal user information (APWG 2012). The most common type of phishing attack leverages email. The emphasis of this paper is to detect phishing attempts within emails. The threat phishing poses to Internet users at large calls for action within the information security industry to create ways of detecting and preventing such attacks. Research into the area of phishing detection has yielded several types of email analysis to determine if an email should be classified as phishing such as link analysis, header analysis, and text analysis. Link analysis refers to the using information about the links included within an email to determine whether the email is legitimate or a phishing attempt. This usually involves checking to see if the displayed link in the email matches the actual website URLthe user is taken to if the link is clicked. Header analysis refers to examining the header contents of an email to decide if the email is a phishing email or not. This analysis typically includes checking that the 'From' field of the email matches the actual sender and checking the IP address from which the email was sent against phishing blacklists. The results obtained in recognizing phishing emails are considerably better than the previously reported work; but the rate of text falsely identified as phishing is slightly worse. It is expected that adding semantic component will reduce the false positive rate while preserving the detection accuracy.
