Abstract The fourth industrial revolution (4IR) is likely to have a substantial impact on the econ- omy. Companies need to build up capabilities to implement new technologies, and automation may make some occupations obsolete. However, where, when, and how the change will happen remain to be determined. Robust empirical indicators of technological progress linked to occu- pations can help to illuminate this change. With this aim, we provide such an indicator based on patent data. Using natural language processing, we calculate patent exposure scores for more than 900 occupations, which represent the technological progress related to them. To provide a lens on the impact of the 4IR, we differentiate between traditional and 4IR patent exposure. Our method differs from previous approaches in that it both accounts for the diversity of task-level patent exposures within an occupation and reflects work activities more accurately. We find that exposure to 4IR patents differs from traditional patent exposure. Manual tasks, and accordingly occupations such as construction and production, are exposed mainly to traditional (non-4IR) patents but have low exposure to 4IR patents. The analysis suggests that 4IR technologies may have a negative impact on job growth; this impact appears 10 to 20 years after patent filing. Re- searchers could validate our findings through further analyses with micro data, and our dataset can serve as a source for more complex labor market analyses. Further, we compared the 4IR ex- posure to other automation and AI exposure scores. Whereas many measures refer to theoretical automation potential, our patent-based indicator reflects actual technology diffusion. We show that a combination of 4IR exposure with other automation measures may provide additional in- sights. For example, near-term automation might be driven by non-4IR technologies. Our work not only allows analyses of the impact of 4IR technologies as a whole, but also provides exposure scores for more than 300 technology fields, such as AI and smart office technologies. Finally, the work provides a general mapping of patents to tasks and occupations, which enables future researchers to construct individual exposure measures.

The current wave of technological progress is driven by digitalization and the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI), and is often referred to as the fourth industrial revolution. AI might enable machines to become increasingly able to perform tasks that previously only humans could perform. Whereas previously machines were mainly able to perform clearly defined, repetitive, routine tasks (Ace- moglu & Autor, 2011), future automation might cover much more diverse tasks, for example, some requiring emotional intelligence (Brynjolfsson & Mitchell, 2017). These new automation patterns create fears of machines making workers obsolete and creating unemployment. How- ever, technological change has various effects on the labor market, and previous waves of au- tomation did not result in long-lasting technology-induced rising unemployment (Mokyr et al., 2015; Autor, 2015; Bessen, 2019). Acemoglu & Restrepo (2019) observe that automation not only decreases labor demand but also has a productivity effect, which increases labor demand. Further, they describe the reinstate- ment effect, where automation leads to newly-created tasks carried out by humans. The relative size of these effects and their interaction determine the overall effect of automation on the labor market. Therefore, automation causes changes in the task content of occupations due to lower demand for some tasks, higher demand for remaining tasks, and the creation of new tasks. To evaluate these effects and prepare for future shifts in the labor market, researchers, e.g., Frey & Osborne (2017) and Brynjolfsson & Mitchell (2017), construct measures of automation potential of occupations. These measures can provide valuable insights for future research in terms of overall automation potential. Our approach does not aspire to predict the share of automated jobs, but aims to reflect actual technology maturity (diffusion), which is not covered by the aforementioned indicators Arntz et al. (2020). For example, scores by Brynjolfsson & Mitchell (2017) are based on expert assessments of Ã¢ÂÂwhat can machine learning do?Ã¢ÂÂ We use patent data as an indicator for technological progress; patents actually document what existing technology can currently do. The McKinsey Global Institute follows a similar objective and focuses on what actual automation might look like until 2030, acknowledging that there is a much higher automation potential in the long term (Manyika et al., 2017). They provide estimates of automation potentials per occupation, which they expect to be implemented until 2030. Linkingdata to occupation activities offers a direct indicator of the exposure of occu- pations to technology. There exist patent occupation mappings at an industry (Silverman, 2002) and occupation level (Kogan et al., 2020; Webb, 2019) which have been used for economic anal- yses (Mann & Pu ÃÂÃÂttmann, 2017; Acemoglu et al., 2020). Webb (2019) found, for example, that exposure to previous automation technologies had a negative impact on employment at an occu- pation level, and Mann & Pu (2017) identified an overall positive impact of automation patents on employment. We build on the approach of Kogan et al. (2020) and refine for improved accuracy and to account for task-level differences. Each occupation relates to several tasks, and technology ex- posure may vary among different tasks within an occupation (Brynjolfsson & Mitchell, 2017). The task level, as the Ã¢ÂÂunit of work that produces output,Ã¢ÂÂ is a highly insightful level of detail for evaluating the impact of technologies on jobs (Acemoglu & Autor, 2011). Our approach has two main benefits. On the one hand, it allows accounting for a specific technology exposure for each task, which is ignored when looking at occupations as a whole. On the other hand, our task-level approach increases the accuracy of the mapping, as it identifies patents specific to each activity, rather than patents which have many words in common with the overall occupation description. For example, our approach might avoid associating a robot engineer mainly with robot patents in general (e.g., improved efficiency of assembly robots), but rather with patents which describe in- novations that help to Ã¢ÂÂplan robot pathÃ¢ÂÂ, Ã¢ÂÂdebug robot programsÃ¢ÂÂ, and Ã¢ÂÂmaintain robots.Ã¢ÂÂ Further, we introduce a measure of technology exposure; we therefore differentiate between technologies of the fourth industrial revolution (4IR patents) and other patents (non-4IR patents) for creating technology exposure scores. These scores indicate patent exposure at the task and occupation level. Our analysis includes patent data since 1970 and thus allows us to review developments over time, e.g., when 4IR technologies have been developed and how long it takes them to impact the labor market. Various researchers identify the lack of high-quality data on technological progress of key 4IR technologies as a key barrier to better understanding the impact of those technologies on the workforce (Frank et al., 2019b; Mitchell & Brynjolfsson, 2017). With this article, we address this issue by providing a mapping of patents to occupational tasks and introducing a 4IR technology exposure score per occupation. Conclusions and future work The aim of this paper is to better understand the exposure of occupations to technologies of the 4IR. Several existing indicators describe the theoretical automation potential or future exposure potential of occupations. We introduce an indicator reflecting actual technology diffusion, based on patent data. This paper presents a method for mapping patents to tasks and introduces an occupation and task-level indicator of exposure to patents of the 4IR (4IR exposure score). We refine existing approaches to better account for task-level differences in patent exposure and the context in which an activity is conducted (e.g., diagnose machine condition vs. diagnose patient condition). We therefore consider that this approach offers a highly valuable contribution towards mapping patents to tasks and occupations. Occupations with higher exposure scores may, for example, be more impacted by 4IR tech- nologies. The analysis shows that ratio of exposure to 4IR and non-4IR patents differs per oc- cupation. Occupations with many manual tasks, such as manufacturing and construction, have high non-4IR exposure and low 4IR exposure, whereas many non-manual occupations, such as finance and marketing occupations, have a higher ratio of 4IR exposure. The 4IR exposure score is also valuable as a complementary score to other technology or automation scores. For example, comparing theoretical and actual technology exposure can provide insights into which occupations might undergo changes through current technologies versus future diffusion. This direct measure of technological progress can provide highly valuable data for further ex- ploration of the impact of technological change on employment (Mitchell & Brynjolfsson, 2017) and may serve as a source for labor market analysis to explore impact patterns of technologies on jobs. We compared our 4IR exposure scores with labor market indicators and found that exposure to non-4IR patents is highest for medium-wage occupations, and that 4IR exposure is highest for high-wage occupations. Further, regression analysis showed a negative (concave) relation of 4IR exposure to job growth. Patent exposure 10 and 20 years ago showed higher coefficients on the impact ongrowth than more recent patent exposure. The gap may reflect the time between invention and technology diffusion and is in line with findings of Kogan et al. (2020). Further analysis with micro data is required to confirm these findings. To estimate the overall impact on the labor market, more complex modeling is required, such as those described for robot patents. Our work not only allows analyses of the impact of 4IR technologies as a whole, but also provides exposure scores for more than 300 technology fields, such as AI and smart office technologies. Finally, the work provides a general mapping of patents to tasks and occupations, which enables future researchers to construct individual exposure measures.
