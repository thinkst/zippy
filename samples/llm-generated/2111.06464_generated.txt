Abstract. Communication is compositional if complex signals can be represented as a combi- nation of simpler subparts. In this paper, we theoretically show that inductive biases on both the training framework and the data are needed to develop a compositional communication. Moreover, we prove that compositionality spontaneously arises in the signaling games, where agents communicate over a noisy channel. We experi- mentally confirm that a range of noise levels, which depends on the model and the data, indeed promotes compositionality. Finally, we provide a comprehensive study of this dependence and report results in terms of recently studied compositionality metrics: topographical similarity, conflict count, and context independence. Introduction In emergent communication studies, one often considers agents who can share information about a set of objects described by the common features. Such a situation is common in multi-agent systems with partial observation (Foerster et al. (2016), Lazaridou et al. (2017), Jaques et al. (2019), Raczaszek-Leonardi et al. (2018)) and it is the major theme in signaling games (Fudenberg and Tirole (1991), Lewis (1969), Skyrms (2010), Lazaridou et al. (2018)). In a signaling game, one agent (a sender) conveys information about an object to another agent (a receiver), which then has to infer the objectÃ¢ÂÂs features. Typically, agents are rewarded if some of the features are correctly identified. During this process, the agents develop a communication protocol. A recent line of work has studied conditions under which compositionality emerges (Batali (1998); Kottur et al. (2017); Choi et al. (2018); Korbak et al. (2019); Li and Bowling (2019); SÃ Âowik et al. (2020b,a); Guo et al. (2020)). Compositionality is a crucial feature of natural languages and it has been investigated extensively in cognitive science (see e.g. Chomsky (1957) Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988)). It is often measured using dedicated metrics such as topographic similarity (Brighton and Kirby (2006); Lazaridou et al. (2018); Kriegeskorte (2008); Bouchacourt and Baroni (2018)), context independence Bogin et al. (2018), conflict count Kucin ÃÂski et al. (2020), or positional disentanglement (Chaabouni et al. (2020)). In signaling games it bears a strong resemblance to the concept of disentangled representations, see (Higgins et al. (2017), Kim and Mnih (2018), Locatello et al. (2019)). In machine learning context, compositionality is perceived as a generalization mechanism (Lake et al. (2017)) and has been used e.g. for goal composition (Jiang et al. (2019)) or knowledge transfer (Li and Bowling (2019)). In this paper, we theoretically show that inductive biases on both the training framework and the data are needed for compositionality to emerge. A similar observation has been made by Kottur et al. (2017); however, our result is more fundamental and points out a common misconception that compositionality can be learned in a purely unsupervised way. Such a result can be perceived as a discrete analog of Locatello et al. (2019), applicable in the communication context. We then prove that adding an inductive bias in the loss function coupled with communication over a noisy channel leads to the spontaneous emergence of compositionality. This shows the catalytic role of noise in this process. Intuitively, this can be attributed to the (partial) robustness of compositional language with respect to message corruption caused by a noisy channel. We experimentally verify that a certain range of noise levels, dependent on the model and the data, promotes compositionality. We provide a wide range of experiments that illustrate the influence of different priors. For the inductive biases in the training framework, we look into the impact of the network architecture as well as implementation and temporal variation in noise. On the data side, we study the effect of scrambling visual input or its description. We also study the generalization properties of the proposed training framework. Related work The topic of communication is actively studied in multi-agent RL, see Hernandez-Leal et al. (2020, Table 2) for a recent survey. Compositionality is often investigated in the context of signaling games (Fudenberg and Tirole (1991),(1969), Skyrms (2010), Lazaridou et al. (2018)). Recent research has shown that strong inductive biases or grounding of communication protocols are necessary for the protocol to be compositional (see e.g. Kottur et al. (2017), SÃ ÃÂowik et al. (2020b)). The inductive bias can be imposed into the architecture of the agents or the training procedure. For instance, Das et al. (2017) place pressure on agents, to use symbols consistently across varying contexts, by a frequent reset of the agentÃ¢ÂÂs memory. A model-based approach was proposed by Choi et al. (2018) and Bogin et al. (2018), who build upon the obverter algorithm (Oliphant and Batali (1997), Batali (1998)). SÃ Âowik et al. (2020a) explore games with hierarchical inputs and shows how agents implemented as graph convolutional networks obtain good generalization. Korbak et al. (2019) implemented the idea of template transfer (Barrett and Skyrms (2019)) by pre-training the agents on simpler subtasks before the target task. Kirby (2001) studied the iterative learning paradigm, where each generation of agents learns the language spoken by the previous generation before starting to communicate. In the machine learning literature, this idea was explored by Li and Bowling (2019), Cogswell et al. (2019) and Ren et al. (2020) with the generation transfer typically implemented as reinitializing the weights of agentsÃ¢ÂÂ neural networks. Such an approach inevitably introduces noise into the learning process. This naturally leads to a question of whether the noise itself may be a sufficient mechanism of learning, which we will try to address in this paper. Guo et al. (2020) have shown that the choice of a game has a large impact on the properties of a communication protocol emerging in that game, foreshadowing what we call grounding. The noisy channel model of communication was famously introduced by Shannon (1948). The idea of noise as a driving force in the emergence of communication was first proposed by Nowak and Krakauer (1999), who showed that word-level compositionality is the optimal solution to the problem of communication in a noisy environment under a particular fitness function. Noise is also used in deep learning, e.g. as a regularizer (see e.g. dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014)) or a mechanism allowing backpropagation through a discrete latent (see e.g. Salakhutdinov and Hinton (2009), Kaiser and Bengio (2018)). Noise in the latter context was used in Foerster et al. (2016) in order to learn to communicate. The authors observed that it is essential for successful training. Conclusions In this paper, we theoretically show that inductive biases on both the training framework and the data are needed for the compositionality to emerge spontaneously in signaling games. We then formulate inductive biases on both the training framework and the data, and prove that inductive biases on both the training framework and the data are needed for the compositionality to emerge spontaneously in signaling games. Consequently, we highlight the need for a robust inductive bias in signaling games. A strong inductive bias is necessary for the compositionality to emerge spontaneously in signaling games, for both the agents and the training procedure.
