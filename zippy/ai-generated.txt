READING, ENGLAND - In a shocking turn of events, a major fire has broken out at a historic building in the heart of Reading. The blaze started at around 10 PM on Monday night, and firefighters have been working tirelessly to bring it under control.

The building in question is the former home of Huntley & Palmers, a biscuit factory that was once a cornerstone of Reading's economy. The factory closed its doors in the 1970s, but the building has since been repurposed as a mixed-use development, housing offices, apartments, and a popular restaurant.

Eyewitnesses reported seeing flames and thick black smoke pouring from the roof of the building. The fire is believed to have started on the top floor of the structure and quickly spread to the lower levels. Firefighters from several nearby towns were called in to assist with the effort, and the area surrounding the building was cordoned off to keep bystanders safe.

As of 2 AM, the fire was still raging, and officials were warning nearby residents to stay indoors and keep their windows closed to avoid inhaling smoke. A spokesperson for the fire department told reporters that the blaze was one of the most challenging they had ever faced, due in part to the age and layout of the building.

'We're doing everything we can to get this fire under control, but it's a difficult situation,' the spokesperson said. 'The building is very old, with lots of nooks and crannies where the fire can spread. We're working closely with our colleagues from neighbouring towns to bring in as much equipment and manpower as possible.'

The cause of the fire is not yet known, and it's too early to say how much damage has been done to the building. However, the restaurant on the ground floor of the structure is believed to have sustained significant damage, and residents of the apartments in the building have been evacuated.

Local officials are urging people to stay away from the area while firefighters work to contain the blaze. The Reading Borough Council has also issued a statement expressing its concern for the safety of those affected by the fire.

This is a developing story, and we will continue to provide updates as more information becomes available.

In the mystical realm of Eldoria, where magic permeated the air and fantastical creatures roamed freely, there existed two extraordinary goats named Astra and Lumina. These magical goats possessed incredible abilities that set them apart from their mundane counterparts.

Astra, with her shimmering ebony coat and eyes that sparkled like starlight, possessed the power to control the elements. She could conjure gusts of wind that danced around her, shaping them into powerful cyclones or gentle breezes. With a mere flick of her tail, she could summon rain to nourish parched lands or call forth lightning to electrify the skies.

Lumina, on the other hand, was a radiant goat with a magnificent coat as white as snow. She had the gift of healing, and her touch could mend wounds and ailments. The mere presence of Lumina filled the hearts of those around her with hope and tranquility. She would wander through the forests and meadows, tending to wounded creatures and bringing solace to troubled souls.

Despite their contrasting powers, Astra and Lumina were inseparable companions. They roamed the enchanted lands together, their hooves treading lightly on the moss-covered paths and their laughter echoing through the ancient trees. Wherever they went, they brought harmony and magic, spreading joy and wonder among the inhabitants of Eldoria.

One fateful day, a dark and malevolent force began to encroach upon Eldoria. An ancient sorcerer, consumed by a thirst for power, sought to harness the magic of the realm for his own twisted desires. He unleashed hordes of dark creatures to spread chaos and destruction, threatening the delicate balance that had been maintained for centuries.

Astra and Lumina sensed the impending danger and understood that it was their duty to protect their cherished realm. With unwavering determination, they set out on a perilous quest to find the legendary Crystal of Unity. Legends spoke of its ability to amplify the magic of those who wielded it, providing a glimmer of hope in the face of darkness.

Their journey took them through treacherous landscapes, where they encountered fierce guardians and overcame daunting challenges. Astra used her elemental powers to create shields and clear obstacles, while Lumina's healing abilities mended their wounds and soothed their fatigue.

Finally, after enduring countless trials, they arrived at the heart of the Forbidden Forest, where the Crystal of Unity lay hidden. It emanated a brilliant, ethereal light, drawing Astra and Lumina closer. As they touched the crystal, a surge of energy coursed through their bodies, intertwining their powers in a dazzling display of unity.

Empowered by the crystal's magic, Astra and Lumina returned to Eldoria. Their combined strength allowed them to combat the sorcerer's dark forces, unleashing powerful gusts of wind that scattered the minions and banished the sorcerer's dark enchantments.

Peace was restored to Eldoria, and the realm rejoiced in the triumph of the two magical goats. Astra and Lumina had proven that true power lies not only in individual abilities but also in the bonds of friendship and unity.

From that day forward, Astra and Lumina were hailed as heroes, their tale passed down through generations. They continued to protect Eldoria, their magic intertwined and their hearts forever united. And as long as their story lived on, hope and enchantment flourished in the land of mystical wonders.

Communities have been advised to stay hydrated and take necessary precautions to avoid heat-related illnesses.

In the Midwest, an uncharacteristically cold spell has gripped states such as Minnesota and Wisconsin, disrupting the spring season. Late-season snowfall has left residents baffled and weary, as they were eagerly anticipating the arrival of warmer weather. The unusual freeze poses a threat to crops, delaying planting schedules and impacting agricultural productivity. Gardeners and farmers are working tirelessly to protect their delicate plants from the unseasonal frost.

Meanwhile, on the East Coast, a series of powerful storms have battered coastal areas, leading to beach erosion and heightened flood risks.

Local communities, governments, and individuals are encouraged to remain vigilant, adapt to changing conditions, and prioritize safety in the face of these challenges. As weather phenomena continue to shape the landscape of the United States, it is essential to foster resilience and cooperation to navigate the uncertain path ahead.

With meteorologists closely monitoring the situation and communities rallying together, the nation stands united in its response to the surprising weather conditions that have swept across the United States, determined to face the challenges head-on and adapt to the new realities dictated by nature's whims.

Headline: Federal Investigation Uncovers Massive Money Laundering Scheme

New York City, May 10, 2023 (AP) – In a major breakthrough, a federal investigation has uncovered a sprawling money laundering scheme with far-reaching implications. Law enforcement agencies, in collaboration with international counterparts, have been working tirelessly to dismantle the elaborate criminal network behind the operation.

The investigation, led by the United States Department of Justice, revealed that the money laundering scheme involved a web of offshore accounts, shell companies, and complex financial transactions. The perpetrators, whose identities have not been disclosed, allegedly utilized these mechanisms to launder illicit funds on an enormous scale.

Authorities estimate that billions of dollars were funneled through the network, involving multiple countries and spanning various industries. The operation employed sophisticated techniques to obscure the origins of the funds, making it a significant challenge for investigators to trace and dismantle.

The Department of Justice, in conjunction with other law enforcement agencies, has made several arrests and executed search warrants in connection with the case. Additional arrests are expected as the investigation continues to unfold.

This discovery serves as a stark reminder of the pervasive nature of financial crimes and the need for robust international cooperation in combating money laundering. Law enforcement agencies are collaborating closely with financial institutions and regulatory bodies to enhance transparency and strengthen anti-money laundering measures.

The case highlights the ongoing efforts to safeguard the integrity of the global financial system and protect it from illicit activities. Authorities are committed to prosecuting those responsible for these crimes to the fullest extent of the law and recovering any ill-gotten gains.

Further details regarding the individuals involved and the extent of the money laundering operation are expected to be disclosed in the coming weeks as the investigation progresses.

Title: The Urgent Need for Climate Action: A Call to Save Our Planet

Introduction:

Climate change is an issue that has gripped the world with its dire consequences. As an 11th grader concerned about our future, it is crucial to understand the impacts of climate change and the urgent need for immediate action. With rising temperatures, melting ice caps, and extreme weather events becoming the new norm, we must take responsibility for the well-being of our planet and future generations.

Body:

1. The Science Behind Climate Change:

Let's start by understanding the science behind climate change. Our planet's atmosphere is composed of greenhouse gases (GHGs) like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases trap heat from the sun, creating the natural greenhouse effect that keeps Earth warm enough for life. However, human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, have significantly increased GHG concentrations in the atmosphere, causing an enhanced greenhouse effect. This, in turn, leads to global warming and climate change.

2. The Impacts of Climate Change:

The impacts of climate change are far-reaching and affect various aspects of our lives. Rising temperatures result in the melting of polar ice caps, leading to a rise in sea levels. This not only endangers coastal communities but also threatens biodiversity and the delicate balance of ecosystems. Extreme weather events like hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense, causing widespread destruction and loss of life.

3. Environmental Justice and Climate Change:

Climate change exacerbates existing social inequalities. Vulnerable communities, including low-income neighborhoods and marginalized groups, often bear the brunt of its consequences. Environmental justice is a crucial aspect of climate action. As an 11th grader, it is our responsibility to raise awareness about the disproportionate impacts on these communities and advocate for equitable solutions.

4. The Role of Renewable Energy:

Transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources is essential to combat climate change. Renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, produces fewer GHG emissions and offers a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels. By advocating for renewable energy policies and supporting the development of clean technologies, we can contribute to a greener and more sustainable future.

5. Individual Actions Matter:

While systemic change is crucial, individual actions also play a significant role. As 11th graders, we can make conscious choices in our daily lives to reduce our carbon footprint. Simple steps like conserving energy, reducing waste, and adopting sustainable transportation options can collectively make a substantial impact.

6. The Importance of Education and Awareness:

Education and awareness are key to fostering a collective understanding of climate change and its implications. As students, we can engage in environmental clubs, organize awareness campaigns, and advocate for climate education in schools. By empowering ourselves with knowledge, we become catalysts for change and inspire others to take action.

Conclusion:

Climate change poses an imminent threat to our planet, and as 11th graders, we cannot afford to turn a blind eye to this crisis. We have a responsibility to raise our voices, take action, and demand change from policymakers and leaders. By understanding the science behind climate change, promoting environmental justice, supporting renewable energy, and making sustainable choices in our daily lives, we can collectively work towards a greener, more sustainable future. The time for action is now, and it is up to us, the young generation, to lead the charge and save our planet for generations to come.

Subject: Promoting Sustainable Tourism for a Greener Future

Dear Editor,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my concern about the environmental impact of tourism and to advocate for promoting sustainable practices in the travel industry.

Tourism plays a significant role in the economic growth of our region, attracting visitors from all around the world to experience the beauty and cultural richness of our destinations. However, it is crucial that we address the environmental challenges associated with this industry.

Firstly, I believe that it is essential to focus on sustainable transportation options for travelers. Encouraging the use of public transportation, cycling, and walking can help reduce carbon emissions and alleviate traffic congestion in popular tourist areas. Furthermore, investing in efficient and eco-friendly public transport systems will not only benefit the environment but also enhance the overall travel experience for visitors.

Secondly, preserving natural resources should be a priority. Our pristine beaches, national parks, and wildlife habitats are valuable assets that need protection. Initiatives such as beach clean-ups, responsible waste management, and educating tourists about the importance of preserving our natural environment can go a long way in ensuring that these areas remain unspoiled for generations to come.

Thirdly, supporting local businesses and communities is crucial for sustainable tourism. Encouraging travelers to choose locally owned accommodations, restaurants, and souvenir shops not only contributes to the local economy but also promotes cultural exchange and fosters a deeper connection between visitors and the destination.

In addition, collaboration between the government, tourism industry, and environmental organizations is vital to implement and monitor sustainable tourism practices. This collaboration can help establish guidelines and certifications for eco-friendly accommodations, promote sustainable tour operators, and raise awareness among travelers about their role in preserving the environment.

Lastly, educating tourists about responsible travel practices is essential. By providing information on how to minimize their ecological footprint, respect local cultures and traditions, and support conservation efforts, we can empower visitors to make informed choices that benefit both the environment and the local communities.

As a community, we have a responsibility to protect and preserve the natural wonders that make our region so attractive to travelers. By embracing sustainable tourism practices, we can create a greener and more sustainable future for our beloved destinations.

I urge local authorities, tourism boards, and stakeholders to collaborate on developing and implementing sustainable tourism strategies. Together, we can ensure that our region continues to thrive while safeguarding the environment for future generations.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I hope that our community can come together and make a positive difference in promoting sustainable tourism practices.

Abstract Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that gives machines the ability to decode human languages. Part- of-speech tagging (POS tagging) is a pre-processing task that requires an annotated corpus. Rule-based and stochastic methods showed remarkable results for POS tag prediction. On this work, I performed a mathematical model based on Hidden Markov structures and I obtained a high-level ac- curacy of ingredients extracted from text recipe with performances greater than what traditional methods could make without unknown words con- sideration. Introduction Artificial intelligence had shown a great progress in the recent years especially the deep learning branch where learning techniques have been improved very quickly. The combination of representation learning and deep learning have allowed the emerging of a new AI class called deep reinforcement learning. Deep Reinforcement learning tend to estimate value functions from exper- iments and simulations and using dynamic programming through Deep Re- inforcement learning is an efficient way to build reactive strategies acting on instantaneous control. An algorithm which approves its performance by experi- ence is an algorithm capable of avoiding his own mistakes through a combination of a strong memory fed by fresh helpful data and the ability to keep winning pre- dictions after a long-term performance (Barto, Bradtke, & Singh, 1995) (Mnih et al., 2015). Neural Network can be considered as a dynamic Reinforcement Learning scheme where the layers are putted in a parallel way to have a cascaded trans- mission of the treated signal (Fukushima & Miyake, 1982) (LeCun et al., 1989) and where a prior knowledge is important to predict the output state of new observations. Sequential modeling is a way to process data in natural language processing by maximizing awards after manipulating situation and producing resulting actions (Vithayathil Varghese & Mahmoud, 2020) (LeCun, Bengio, & Hinton, 2015). A sequential model representation is influenced by its data representation and how tensors are trained to produce an optimal control (Bengio, Courville, & Vincent, 2013) To improve the target learning task, transfer learning is used as a powerful technique to increase the value of the most probable cases inside a state matrix (Boutsioukis, Partalas, & Vlahavas, 2011). Transferring the knowledge helps us to reduce the amount of data consumed and rely on feature engineering to reduce the noise caused by annotation errors and other tag-set anomalies in a context of multi-agent system. Extracting ingredients automatically from a recipe text is an extremely use- ful activity especially when we want to analyze a massive data of text recipes. Rule-Based methods were implemented to extract information from unstruc- tured recipe data (Silva, Ribeiro, & Ferreira, 2019) Ingredients is not the only useful information we want to extract; in this work we are going to use Hidden Markov Models especially Viterbi algorithm with some modification to make it receiving two unique features: POS-tags and tokens, to predict ingredient states. Previous works Many previous works were interested in analyzing cuisine recipes, for exam- ple Sina Sajadmanesh (Sajadmanesh et al., 2017) presented an analysis of the ingredients diversity around the word using an ingredient-based classifier to dif- ferentiate between recipes around the word based on its geographical identity. Sina Sajadmanesh (Sajadmanesh et al., 2017) studied the diversity of ingredi- ents in dishes with introduction of global diversity (the ability to have diversified ingredients between recipes) and local diversity (the ability to have diversified ingredients within a recipe). Other related work for culinary habits is Yong-Yeol Ahn paper (Ahn, Ahnert, Bagrow, & Barab ÃÂasi, 2011) who introduced the notion of Flavor Network and tried to verify the Food Paring hypothesis introduced on the 90Ã¢ÂÂs by Heston Blumenthal and Francois Benzi. Flavor network as described by Ahn is a graph where the nodes are the ingredients extracted from recipes and weights are shared flavors between nodes. Food paring hypothesis is an indicator calculated after forming the Flavor Network to show if in a country or in a geographical part of the word we have tasty recipes or the ingredients do not have similar molecules. Tiago Simas (Simas, Ficek, Diaz-Guilera, Obrador, & Rodriguez, 2017) introduced the notion of food bridging formed with semi-metric distances. A group of scientists in a recent publication (Van Erp et al., 2021)oped a state of the art of the use of artificial intelligence and natural language processing in analyzing food recipes. In this article we can found collected ref- erences talking about the challenging part in collecting food and recipe data. For example, Ahnert (Ahnert, 2013) presented the emergence of computational gastronomy in food science and its effect on culinary practices. (Amato & Cozzolino, 2017) Ingredients is not the only useful information we want to extract; in this work we are going to use Hidden Markov Models especially Viterbi algorithm with some modification to make it receiving two unique features: POS-tags and tokens, to predict ingredient states.

Sina Sajadmanesh (Sajadmanesh et al., 2017) presented the emergence of artificial intelligence and natural language processing in food science. I agree with (Van Erp et al., 2021) concerning how challenging to use IA in food domain and how it will resolve issues concerning the creation of a data driven analysis of nutrition. In our paper data extracted can be used in a phone application or a recommended system for people who want to take care of their health. All previously cited researches on cuisine recipes need information extrac- tion from text recipe to use it on graphical visualization and statistical analysis. Information extraction can be used manually by extracting ingredients indi- cated on recipes or automatically. The problem in automatic extraction is that information should be precise to have also precise analysis, for example some ingredients take only one word and others can take two or three words. Another problem on automatic information extraction is that some ingredients that take one word have in common some words with other ingredients that have more than one word which make automatic information extraction more difficult.

Abstract We provide a hands-on introduction to optimized textual sentiment indexation using the R package sentometrics. Textual sentiment analysis is increasingly used to unlock the potential information value of textual data. The sentometrics package implements an intuitive framework to efficiently compute sentiment scores of numerous texts, to aggregate the scores into multiple time series, and to use these time series to predict other variables. The workflow of the package is illustrated with a built-in corpus of news articles from two major U.S. journals to forecast the CBOE Volatility Index. Keywords: Aggregation, Penalized Regression, Prediction, R, sentometrics, Textual Senti- ment, Time Series. Introduction Individuals, companies, and governments continuously consume written material from various sources to improve their decisions. The corpus of texts is typically of a high-dimensional longitudinal nature requiring statistical tools to extract the relevant information. A key source of information is the sentiment transmitted through texts, called textual sentiment. Algaba, Ardia, Bluteau, Borms, and Boudt (2020) review the notion of sentiment and its applications, mainly in economics and finance. They define sentiment as Ã¢ÂÂthe disposition of an entity towards an entity, expressed via a certain medium.Ã¢ÂÂ The medium in this case is texts. The sentiment expressed through texts may provide valuable insights on the future dynamics of variables related to firms, the economy, political agendas, product satisfaction, and marketing campaigns, for instance. Still, textual sentiment does not live by the premise to be equally useful across all applications. Deciphering when, to what degree, and which layers of the sentiment add value is needed to consistently study the full information potential present within qualitative communications. The econometric approach of constructing time series of sentiment by means of optimized selection and weighting of textual sentiment is referred to as sentometrics by Algaba et al. (2020) and Ardia, Bluteau, and Boudt (2019). The term sentometrics is a composition of (textual) sentiment analysis and (time series) econometrics. The release of the R (R Core Team 2021) text mining infrastructure tm (Feinerer, Hornik, and Meyer 2008) over a decade ago can be considered the starting point of the development and popularization of textual analysis tools in R. A number of successful follow-up attempts at improving the speed and interface of the comprehensive natural language processing capabil- ities provided by tm have been delivered by the packages openNLP (Hornik 2019), cleanNLP (Arnold 2017), quanteda (Benoit, Watanabe, Wang, Nulty, Obeng, MuÃÂller, and Matsuo 2018), tidytext (Silge and Robinson 2016), and qdap (Rinker 2020). The notable tailor-made packages for sentiment analysis in R are meanr (Schmidt 2019), SentimentAnalysis (Feuerriegel and Proellochs 2021), sentimentr (Rinker 2019b), and syuzhet (Jockers 2020). Many of these packages rely on one of the larger above-mentioned textual analysis infrastructures. The meanr package computes net sentiment scores fastest, but offers no flexibility.1 The SentimentAnalysis package relies on a similar calculation as used in tmÃ¢ÂÂs sentiment scoring function. The package can additionally be used to generate and evaluate sentiment dictionaries. The sentimentr package extends the polarity scoring function from the qdap package to handle more difficult linguistic edge cases, but is therefore slower than packages which do not attempt this. The SentimentAnalysis and syuzhet packages also become comparatively slower for large input corpora. The quanteda and tidytext packages have no explicit sentiment computation function but their toolsets can be used to construct one. Our R package sentometrics proposes a well-defined modeling workflow, specifically targeted at studying the evolution of textual sentiment and its impact on other quantities. It can be used (i) to compute textual sentiment, (ii) to aggregate fine-grained textual sentiment into various sentiment time series, and (iii) to predict other variables with these sentiment measures. The combination of these three facilities leads to a flexible and computationally efficient framework to exploit the information value of sentiment in texts. The package presented in this paper therefore addresses the present lack of analytical capability to extract time series intelligence about the sentiment transmitted through a large panel of texts. Furthermore, the sentometrics package positions itself as both integrative and supplementary to the powerful textand data science toolboxes in the R universe. It is integrative, as it combines the strengths of quanteda and stringi (Gagolewski 2021) for corpus construction and manipulation. It uses data.table (Dowle and Srinivasan 2021) for fast aggregation of textual sentiment into time series, and glmnet (Friedman, Hastie, and Tibshirani 2010) and caret (Kuhn 2021) for (sparse) model estimation. The time series and time series packages also become available. The time series and time series packages also become available. The time series and time series packages also become available. The time series and time series packages also become available. The packages time series (Feinerer, Hornik, and Meyer 2008) and time series (Gagolewski and Srinivasan 2021). The release of the R (R Core Team 2021) text mining infrastructure tm (Feinerer, Hornik, and Meyer 2008) over a decade ago can be considered the starting point of the development and popularization of textual analysis tools in R. A number of successful follow-up attempts at improving the speed and interface of the comprehensive natural language processing capabil- ities provided by tm have been delivered by the packages openNLP (Hornik 2021), cleanNLP (Arnold 2017), quanteda (Benoit, Watanabe, Wang, Nulty, Obeng, MuÃÂller, and Matsuo 2018), tidytext (Silge and Robinson 2016), and qdap (Rinker 2020).

The Alchemist: A Journey of Self-Discovery

Hey, fellow bookworms! Today, I want to dive into the incredible world of "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho. If you're into adventure, self-discovery, and a little bit of magic, this book is definitely for you. Strap in as we explore the life-changing journey of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy, and the valuable life lessons he learns along the way.

"The Alchemist" is set in the vibrant and mysterious land of Spain. Santiago, our young protagonist, starts off as an ordinary shepherd tending his sheep in the rolling hills of Andalusia. However, he's not content with his mundane life and dreams of finding hidden treasures and experiencing the wonders of the world. Who can't relate to that feeling of yearning for something more exciting?

As the story unfolds, Santiago meets an intriguing character, the King of Salem, who encourages him to follow his Personal Legend, a destiny that leads each person to their true purpose in life. This concept really struck a chord with me, as I often wonder what my own Personal Legend might be. Santiago's journey becomes an allegorical representation of our own quests for self-discovery.

Along his journey, Santiago encounters many fascinating individuals who teach him important life lessons. The crystal merchant, for example, teaches him about the danger of settling for mediocrity and the importance of pursuing one's dreams. This resonated with me because it's easy to fall into a routine and forget to pursue our passions. The crystal merchant's regret serves as a reminder to never let our dreams slip away.

One of the most impactful characters in the book is the alchemist himself. This wise and enigmatic figure becomes Santiago's mentor, guiding him through the desert and imparting invaluable wisdom. The alchemist teaches Santiago the importance of listening to one's heart and connecting with the Soul of the World. It's a profound message that reminds us to trust our instincts and have faith in the universe.

Coelho's writing style is simple yet powerful, making "The Alchemist" accessible and captivating for readers of all ages. His use of vivid imagery allows us to visualize the breathtaking landscapes Santiago encounters on his journey. From the vast Egyptian pyramids to the endless desert dunes, each description paints a picture in our minds that transports us right into the heart of the story.

What I found particularly inspiring about "The Alchemist" is its exploration of the theme of perseverance. Santiago faces numerous setbacks and challenges, but he never gives up on his dreams. This resonated with me as a high school student, as I often feel overwhelmed by the pressures of academics and future uncertainties. Santiago's unwavering determination encouraged me to keep pushing forward, no matter how tough the journey may be.

Another aspect of the book that I loved is the magical realism woven throughout the narrative. Coelho seamlessly blends elements of fantasy and spirituality with the realities of Santiago's journey. It's as if the magical moments serve as reminders that the universe is full of possibilities and that there's more to life than what meets the eye. This blend of realism and mysticism creates a sense of wonder and enchantment that keeps the reader engaged from start to finish.

In conclusion, "The Alchemist" is a captivating tale of self-discovery and following one's dreams. Through Santiago's journey, we learn valuable life lessons about perseverance, listening to our hearts, and embracing the magic of the world around us. Coelho's simple yet evocative writing style and the book's themes of personal growth make it a must-read for anyone seeking inspiration and a deeper understanding of their own journey in life. So grab a copy, embark on this transformative adventure, and discover your own Personal Legend. Happy reading!

Abstract This work explores the capacities of character- based Neural Machine Translation to translate noisy User-Generated Content (UGC) with a strong focus on exploring the limits of such ap- proaches to handle productive UGC phenom- ena, which almost by definition, cannot be seen at training time. Within a strict zero- shot scenario, we first study the detrimental impact on translation performance of various user-generated content phenomena on a small annotated dataset we developed, and then show that such models are indeed incapable of han- dling unknown letters, which leads to catastrophic translation failure once such characters are encountered. We further confirm this be- havior with a simple, yet insightful, copy task experiment and highlight the importance of reducing the vocabulary size hyper-parameter to increase the robustness of character-based models for machine translation. Introduction. Neural Machine Translation (NMT) models fall far short from being able to translate noisy User- Generated Content (UGC): the quality of their translation is often even worse than that of a traditional phrase-based system (Khayrallah and Koehn, 2018; Rosales NuÃÂnÃÂez et al., 2019). In addi- tion to ambiguous grammatical constructs and pro- fusion of ellipsis, the main difficulty encountered when translating UGC is the high number of out- of-vocabulary tokens (OOVs) resulting from mis- spelled words, emoticons, hashtags, mentions, and all specific constructs used in online forums and social medias (Foster, 2010; Seddah et al., 2012; Eisenstein, 2013; Sanguinetti et al., 2020). Some of those phenomena can be perceived as noise while the others are typical markers of language variation among speakers. Moreover, a certain amount of those same phenomena operate at the lexical level (either at the character, subword or word levels) (Sanguinetti et al., 2020). This is why, focusing more on the noise axis, char-based mod- els appear to offer a natural solution to this prob- lem (Luong and Manning, 2016; Ling et al., 2015): indeed these open vocabulary models are designed specifically to address the OOV problem. In this work, we explore the ability of out-of- the-box character-based NMT models (Lee et al., 2017) to address the challenges raised by UGC translation. While character-based models may seem promising for such task, to the best of our knowledge, they have only been tested either on data sets in which noise has been artificially added through sampling an edited word error data set (Be- linkov and Bisk, 2018; Ebrahimi et al., 2018a) and on canonical data set, in which they prove to be very effective for translating morphologically-rich languages with a high number of OOVs (Luong and Manning, 2016). However, our starting-points experiments show that character-based systems are outperformed by BPE models even when translating noisy UGC. To understand this counter-intuitive result, we con- duct several experiments and analyses. In partic- ular, we manually annotated 400 sentences at the token level using a fine-grained typology, to per- form our analyses. These sentences correspond to the worst and the best translated utterances of two MT systems (a char-based and a transformer-based model). Our results highlight the extreme sensi- bility of character-based models to the vocabulary size, a parameter often overlooked in the literature. Using a simple set of experiments, we thus show that these models are unable to perform an easy copy task due to their poor handling of unknown and rare characters. By adjusting the vocabulary size parameter, we drastically improve the robust- ness of our character-based model without causing a large drop in in-domain performance. Our contributions are as follows: Ã¢ÂÂ¢ we provide an annotated data set that enables in-depth evaluations of the impact of UGC idiosyncrasies; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ we demonstrate that char-based neural machine translation models are extremely sensi- tive to unknown and rare characters on both synthetic data and noisy user-generated content; Ã¢ÂÂ¢ we show how an overlooked hyper-parameter drastically improve char-based MT models ro- bustness to natural noise while maintaining the in-domain level of performance. Conclusion We showed that in zero-shot scenarios, char-based models are not robust to UGC idiosyncrasies. We presented several experiments that explained this counter-intuitive result by an over-sensibility of these models to the vocabulary size. We demonstrated that drastically lowering this param- eterthe robustness of our char-based models when facing noisy UGC while maintaining almost the same level of performance for in-domain and out-of-domain canonical datasets. Interestingly, we noticed a lack in the literature regarding the importance of vocabulary considerations when training character-based NMTmodels.

The family of Michael Brown has launched a new online campaign, #StolenLives, calling on people to set a seat at their Thanksgiving dinner table for victims of police violence. The campaign, which is being run by advocacy group Ferguson Action, aims to raise awareness about the issue of police violence and the impact it has on families whose loved ones have been killed or injured in such incidents. The campaign was kickstarted by the Brown family, who shared a haunting picture online of an empty chair at their Thanksgiving table, symbolizing the absence of Michael Brown, who was killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014. The image quickly went viral, with thousands of people sharing it on social media and expressing their support for the campaign. Since then, #StolenLives has gained momentum, with people across the country joining in and setting a seat at their own dinner tables to honor the memory of victims of police violence. The campaign is also calling on people to share their stories and experiences of police violence on social media, using the hashtag #StolenLives to raise awareness about the issue. According to data compiled by the advocacy group Mapping Police Violence, there have been over 1,000 people killed by police in the United States this year alone. Black people are three times more likely to be killed by police than white people, and unarmed black people are five times more likely to be killed by police than unarmed white people. For the families of these victims, the pain and trauma of losing a loved one to police violence can be overwhelming. Many families struggle to find justice and closure, and the impact of the loss can be felt for years to come. The #StolenLives campaign aims to bring attention to this issue and to remind people that behind every statistic is a person with a family, friends, and a life that was cut short. By setting a seat at their Thanksgiving tables for victims of police violence, people are honoring those who have been lost and sending a message that their lives mattered. The Ferguson Action group behind the campaign is also calling on lawmakers and law enforcement agencies to take action to address the issue of police violence. They are calling for reforms to policing practices, including ending racial profiling, improving training for law enforcement officers, and holding police officers accountable for their actions. The #StolenLives campaign comes at a time when the issue of police violence is in the spotlight, with protests and demonstrations taking place across the country in response to the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis earlier this year. The campaign serves as a reminder that the issue of police violence is not new, and that it will take continued activism and advocacy to bring about real change. As people across the country gather with family and friends to celebrate Thanksgiving this year, the #StolenLives campaign is calling on them to remember those who are not able to join them at the dinner table. By honoring the memory of victims of police violence, the campaign is sending a powerful message that their lives mattered, and that their stories must be heard.

In a bipartisan move, the House voted against funding for a second engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The amendment to end the funding was passed with a vote of 233-198. This decision was supported by President Barack Obama, who had recommended the program's elimination in his budget proposal. House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican from Ohio, had shown support for the program, but ultimately fell in line with his party to vote against the funding. The proposed second engine for the F-35, a fighter jet designed to replace older aircraft, had been highly controversial due to its high cost and potential redundancy. This decision to end funding for the program was seen as a significant victory for those who believed the money would be better spent elsewhere, especially in light of the current economic climate. Critics of the proposed second engine also argued that it would delay the completion of the F-35 project and undermine its efficacy. The vote against the funding for the second engine was a clear manifestation of the country's struggle to balance defense spending with budgetary constraints. It was also a display of the willingness of lawmakers to work across party lines to achieve a common goal.

Two teenage girls from Somalia have gone missing from their foster home in Croydon, London. Zeenat Abdala, 16, and Lutfiya Salum left their house at midday yesterday to visit the library, but have not returned home since. The two youngsters came to the UK from Somalia earlier this year and were under the care of a foster family in Croydon. According to the police, the girls may have left to visit their family who recently arrived in the UK. The police have launched an extensive search operation to find the missing teenagers. They have urged people from the local community who may have seen the girls to come forward and report any information that may be useful in finding them. Detective Inspector David Head, from the Metropolitan Police, said: \"We are concerned for the welfare of these two young girls who have no doubt been through a traumatic experience in their lives. We urge anyone who may have seen them or have any information about their whereabouts to come forward and contact us.” The police are currently carrying out door-to-door inquiries in the local area, and have also appealed to anyone who may have seen the girls using public transport or on foot. Meanwhile, the foster family of the missing girls are said to be “distraught” and are cooperating with the police in their search. It is believed that the girls had never gone missing before and their disappearance has come as a shock to their foster parents. The police have also issued a public appeal on social media, urging people to share any information they may have on the whereabouts of the teenagers. They have asked the public to contact the police on the emergency 999 number immediately if they see or hear anything that may be related to the two missing girls. The search for the two girls continues, and the police are urging anyone with information to come forward as soon as possible.

Review of "Creed III" (2023)

"Creed III" has marked its spot as one of the standout films over the past couple of years. Released in 2023, this film is notable not just for continuing the storied legacy of the "Creed" franchise but also for being Michael B. Jordan's directorial debut, an aspect that has added a fresh layer to the narrative and its execution.

Plot and Performance
In this third installment, the focus remains on Adonis Creed's life both inside and outside the boxing ring. The film delves deeper into his personal challenges and triumphs, adding a rich layer to his character's journey. Jordan's performance is, as expected, deeply engaging, and he successfully captures the essence of a seasoned fighter facing new life challenges. The inclusion of Jonathan Majors as a key character introduces a compelling dynamic, enhancing the story's depth and emotional impact.

Critical Reception
"Creed III" has received positive reviews for its direction and performance, particularly praising Jordan's transition behind the camera. Critics and audiences have noted the film's ability to maintain the emotional weight and excitement that the series is known for. With a solid Rotten Tomatoes score of 88% and an IMDb rating of 7/10, the film has clearly resonated well with viewers, appreciating both its narrative and the technical prowess displayed ([Here Are the Top 10 Movies of the Last 2 Years (That You Can Watch Right Now) - Blavity](https://blavity.com/entertainment/top-ten-movies-of-the-last-two-years)).

The 2026 U.S. House elections are shaping up to be highly competitive, with several races already attracting attention due to their potential to influence the overall balance of power in the House. According to analyses from Inside Elections and Cook Political Report, some of the most closely watched contests include:

1. **New York's 17th District** - This district is particularly intriguing because Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican, is considering a gubernatorial run. If Lawler does run for governor, his departure would create an open seat in a district where the Democrats have a significant opportunity to gain a seat, given the district's previous voting patterns favoring Vice President Kamala Harris over Donald Trump.

2. **Maine's 2nd District** - Democratic Rep. Jared Golden, who has successfully held onto this district where Trump previously outperformed Harris, is speculated to be considering a gubernatorial bid. An open seat here would likely be a prime target for Republican challengers, making it a crucial district for Democrats to defend.

3. **Texas's 34th District** - This district is a critical watch due to shifting demographics and political allegiances. Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez narrowly won reelection last cycle, and continued shifts in Hispanic voter trends could make this district more competitive for Republicans.

4. **Colorado's 8th District** - Having been highly competitive since its creation, this district saw a narrow victory for Republican Gabe Evans in 2024 after a slight shift toward Trump in the previous election cycle. It remains a key battleground that Democrats need to target for regaining the majority.

5. **Minnesota's 2nd District** - Represented by Democrat Angie Craig, this district has shown resilience against Republican challenges. However, if Craig decides to run for the Senate, her departure could open up another competitive race in a district that has leaned Democratic in recent elections.

These districts are part of a broader strategic landscape where both parties are grappling with vulnerabilities in key areas, as noted by Cook Political Report. The outcomes in these districts could very well decide which party controls the House after the 2026 elections.
